## Capturing Network Traffic üì∑üì∏
With Wireshark installed, it's time to create our input data, which will consist of a captured pcap file. This file will include all network traffic to and from our device during the capture period.

### Steps to Capture Network Traffic
<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary>
  
1. **Open Wireshark**:
   - Launch the Wireshark application on your device.

2. **Select a Network Interface**:
   - Choose the network interface you want to capture traffic from (e.g., Wi-Fi, Ethernet).
   - Double-click on the interface to start capturing.
  
     <div> 
       <img src="https://github.com/Kumarabhijeet1608/Network-Tracking-using-Wireshark-and-Google-Maps/blob/main/1.png" /> 
     </div>

When selecting an interface, Wireshark automatically starts a new capture, which is why you immediately get prompted with network traffic.

3. **Start Capturing Traffic**:
   - Wireshark will begin capturing all network traffic on the selected interface.
   - Perform the network activities you want to monitor during this capture period.

     <div> 
       <img src="https://github.com/Kumarabhijeet1608/Network-Tracking-using-Wireshark-and-Google-Maps/blob/main/2.png" /> 
     </div>

4. **Stop the Capture**:
   - After you have captured sufficient data, click on the red square (Stop) button in Wireshark to stop the capture.

Once the capture has been stopped you need to export the captured data in pcap format, this can be done by clicking File -> Export Specified Packets.
      <div> 
         <img src="https://github.com/Kumarabhijeet1608/Network-Tracking-using-Wireshark-and-Google-Maps/blob/main/3.png" /> 
      </div>

5. **Save the Capture File**:
   - Save the file with a `.pcap` extension.
   - Ex: wire.pcap

     <div> 
       <img src="https://github.com/Kumarabhijeet1608/Network-Tracking-using-Wireshark-and-Google-Maps/blob/main/4.png" /> 
     </div>
     
This pcap file will serve as the input for our Python script and will be the data displayed on Google Maps in the subsequent steps of the readme.

# Python Implementation üë©‚Äçüíªüë®‚Äçüíª
# First, import the necessary libraries

```python
import dpkt
import socket
import pygeoip

gi = pygeoip.GeoIP('GeoLiteCity.dat')
```

As you might observe, a variable is initialized with the GeoLiteCity database that was downloaded earlier. Ensure that the GeoLiteCity.dat file is placed in the root folder of your Python project unless you intend to modify the path of the variable.

# Implementing the Main Method
Next, you will implement the main method, which will open your captured data, and create the header and footer of the KML file. This KML file will serve as the output file that we will upload to Google Maps.

## Steps:

1. **Open Captured Data**:
   - Open your captured data file (`.pcap`) located at the root of the project.

2. **Create Header and Footer**:
   - Generate the header and footer of the KML file, which is the output file that we will upload to Google Maps.
  
Again be sure to place you captured .pcap file in the root of the project and change the name of the code below if you did not save it under the name wire.pcap

## Python Code:

```python
def main():
    f = open('wire.pcap', 'rb')
    pcap = dpkt.pcap.Reader(f)
    kmlheader = '<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> \n<kml xmlns="http://www.opengis.net/kml/2.2">\n<Document>\n'\
    '<Style id="transBluePoly">' \
                '<LineStyle>' \
                '<width>1.5</width>' \
                '<color>501400E6</color>' \
                '</LineStyle>' \
                '</Style>'
    kmlfooter = '</Document>\n</kml>\n'
    kmldoc=kmlheader+plotIPs(pcap)+kmlfooter
    print(kmldoc)
```
If you wish to change the styling of the lines that will be drawn in Google Maps, you will do so in the above code under the <style></style> tags.
Next, we'll add the method that will loop over our captured network data and extract the IP addresses.

```python
def plotIPs(pcap):
    kmlPts = ''
    for (ts, buf) in pcap:
        try:
            eth = dpkt.ethernet.Ethernet(buf)
            ip = eth.data
            src = socket.inet_ntoa(ip.src)
            dst = socket.inet_ntoa(ip.dst)
            KML = retKML(dst, src)
            kmlPts = kmlPts + KML
        except:
            pass
    return kmlPts
```

In the plotIPs(pcap) method mentioned above, the application will iterate over our pcap data and extract the source and destination IP addresses of each captured network packet.

However, our IP addresses alone cannot be used as input to Google Maps. We first need to associate each IP address with a geographic location. This will be accomplished using the following method:

```python
def retKML(dstip, srcip):
    dst = gi.record_by_name(dstip)
    src = gi.record_by_name('x.xxx.xxx.xxx')
    try:
        dstlongitude = dst['longitude']
        dstlatitude = dst['latitude']
        srclongitude = src['longitude']
        srclatitude = src['latitude']
        kml = (
            '<Placemark>\n'
            '<name>%s</name>\n'
            '<extrude>1</extrude>\n'
            '<tessellate>1</tessellate>\n'
            '<styleUrl>#transBluePoly</styleUrl>\n'
            '<LineString>\n'
            '<coordinates>%6f,%6f\n%6f,%6f</coordinates>\n'
            '</LineString>\n'
            '</Placemark>\n'
        )%(dstip, dstlongitude, dstlatitude, srclongitude, srclatitude)
        return kml
    except:
        return ''
```
In the above method, Geo locations are located for each IP address followed by a conversion into KML format.

Be aware that in the above example, I have masked my source IP address with "x.xxx.xxx.xxx". To make the code work for your network, you will need to navigate to [https://www.whatsmyip.org/](https://www.whatsmyip.org/) and locate your IP address, then replace "x.xxx.xxx.xxx" with your actual IP address in the code.

The reason for this is that our captured pcap data file contains internal IP addresses, which are not known outside our home network. Capturing the external IP automatically would require additional steps and is beyond the scope of this tutorial.

# Execute the above code using:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

## Adding Data to Google Maps

With our newly created .kml file, we‚Äôre now ready to add it to Google Maps. 

1. Navigate to [Google My Maps](https://www.google.com/mymaps).
2. Create a new map or select an existing one.
3. Click on "Import" and select "Import from file".
4. Choose the .kml file that we generated earlier.
5. Once uploaded, the data from the .kml file will be displayed on your map.
6. Now you should see the network traffic being displayed on the map.

Now you can visualize your network traffic data on Google Maps!
